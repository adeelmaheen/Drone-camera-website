## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the website structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling (via `styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (via `main.js`).
- **Remixicon**: For icons used in the navigation and footer.
- **ScrollReveal**: For scroll-based animations.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website structure.
- `styles.css`: Custom CSS for styling the website.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file for handling interactivity and animations.
- `assets/`: Directory containing images used across the website (e.g., `header.png`, `about.jpg`, `product-1.jpg`, etc.).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download**: Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. **Open `index.html`**: Use a web browser to open the `index.html` file or serve it via a local server (e.g., using `Live Server` in VS Code).
3. **Dependencies**:
   - The website uses external CDNs for Remixicon (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@3.6.0/fonts/remixicon.css`) and ScrollReveal (`https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal`).
   - Ensure an internet connection to load these resources, or host them locally if needed.
4. **Assets**: Ensure the `assets/` directory is in the same directory as `index.html` to load images correctly.

## Usage
- Navigate through the website using the top navigation bar or the mobile menu (accessible via the hamburger icon).
- Explore sections like Products and Gallery to learn about different drone applications and models.
- Subscribe to the newsletter in the Subscription section to stay updated.
- Use the footer links to access additional resources or contact information.

## Notes
- The website assumes the presence of a `styles.css` file for styling and a `main.js` file for JavaScript functionality. Ensure these files are properly linked and implemented.
- Image paths in the `assets/` directory must match the referenced filenames in `index.html`.
- The subscription form is a placeholder and requires backend integration for functionality.
